<b><h3>1. A Mother Language</h3></b>
<p>Select one Mother Language, and search for tutorials for it!
<br>
What I highly recommend is learning Java, CPP, or C as a first language, as it makes you *forcibly* learn topics like OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and TDD (Test-Driven Development) and other principles like KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and System Design.<br>
Essential Topics :<br>
<ul>
<li>Strings</li><li>Arrays</li><li>OOP (Polymorphism, Abstraction, etc..)</li>
<li>Design Patterns</li><li>Network Sockets (TCP,UDP)</li>
</ul>
You have to learn these in your language. For example, try to learn about how to transfer data through TCP using CPP (or your language). And how to handle errors.
</p>
<b><h3>2. Select a route</h3></b>
<p>
<b>A. Web Development</b><br>
Learn about HTML, CSS, JS(Fundamentals Only), then you can learn other technologies for Frontend like Bootstrap, or for backend like Java Servlet, PHP, Node.js, and others!<br>
<b>B. Desktop Development</b><br>
Learn about GUI and graphics libraries in your language. For java, it would be Swing and AWT, search for your own.<br>
<b>C. Android Development</b><br>
Learn Java or Kotlin, other languages like Dart are trendy now (as of 7 Dec. 2021), so take a look at each one and compare.<br>
<b>D. Cyber Security</b><br>
You'll learn *more* about Networking and protocols, you should be familiar how HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS works. I recommend taking CCNA (certificate not required) to learn more about networking. Also, it's required to take CEH (certificate not required) as it's the portal to cyber security.
