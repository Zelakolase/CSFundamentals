## A Mother Language

Select one Mother Language, and search for tutorials for it!What I highly recommend is learning Java, CPP, or C as a first language, as it makes you _forcibly_ learn topics like OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and TDD (Test-Driven Development) and other principles like KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and System Design.Essential Topics :

- Strings
- Arrays
- OOP (Polymorphism, Abstraction, etc..)
- Design Patterns
- Network Sockets (TCP, UDP)

You have to learn these in your language. For example, try to learn about how to transfer data through TCP using CPP (or your language). And how to handle errors.

## \***\*Select a route\*\***

- **Web Development**

Learn about HTML, CSS, JS(Fundamentals Only), then you can learn other technologies for Frontend like Bootstrap, or for backend like Java Servlet, PHP, Node.js, and others!

- **Desktop Development**

Learn about GUI and graphics libraries in your language. For java, it would be Swing and AWT, search for your own.

- **Android Development**

Learn Java or Kotlin, other languages like Dart are trendy now (as of 7 Dec. 2021), so take a look at each one and compare.

- **Cyber Security**

You'll learn _more_ about Networking and protocols, you should be familiar how HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS works. I recommend taking CCNA (certificate not required) to learn more about networking. Also, it's required to take CEH (certificate not required) as it's the portal to cyber security.
