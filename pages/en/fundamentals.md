## **Fundamentals for Networking**

Networking is a fundamental thing to learn, you'll learn about the most popular internet protocols like TCP or UDP, Networking tells you how computers communicate to each other in order to exchange data.

[I personally recommend this tutoria](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/netsandinets/)l as it explains Networking in simple words, instead of directly going through what's ACK.

**I recommend you to search about what's HTTP and what's DNS. Use google**
