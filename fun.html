<b><h3>1. Learn Computer Programming Basics</h3></b>
<p>
<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_basics.htm">This</a> Tutorial is highly recommended.<br>
Also, Other articles like <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/basics-of-computer-programming/">this one</a> is optional, but recommended.
</p>
<b><h3>2. Learn Digital Logic</h3></b>
<p>
This is a *critical* principle in computer science. Videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI-qXk7XojA">this one</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQBRzsPhw2w">this one</a> would be critical to your learning.
</p>
<b><h3>3. Fundamentals for Networking</h3></b>
<p>
Networking is a fundamental thing to learn, you'll learn about the most popular internet protocols like TCP or UDP, Networking tells you how computers communicate to each other in order to exchange data.<br>
<a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/netsandinets/">I personally recommend this tutorial</a> as it explains Networking in simple words, instead of directly going through what's ACK.<br><b> I recommend you to search about what's HTTP and what's DNS. Use google!</b>
